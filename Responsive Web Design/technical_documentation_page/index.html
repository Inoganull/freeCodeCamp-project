            <article>
                <p>Before diving into PHP, it's helpful to have a basic understanding of certain concepts and technologies. Familiarity with the following will provide a solid foundation for learning PHP:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML: Having a grasp of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is essential. Understanding how to structure web pages, work with tags, and create basic layouts will complement your PHP development.</li>
                    <li>CSS: Knowledge of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is beneficial as well. CSS is used to style and format web pages, allowing you to control the appearance of elements. Being able to apply styles and understand selectors will enhance your PHP-driven websites.</li>
                    <li>Programming Fundamentals: Understanding fundamental programming concepts like variables, data types, conditionals, loops, and functions is crucial. These concepts are the building blocks of any programming language, including PHP.</li>
                    <li>Web Server Basics: Having a basic understanding of how web servers work is advantageous. Familiarize yourself with concepts like client-server communication, HTTP requests and responses, and the role of a server-side language like PHP in processing requests.</li>
                    <li>Databases and SQL: Knowledge of databases and SQL (Structured Query Language) is valuable, as PHP is commonly used for database-driven web applications. Understanding concepts like tables, queries, and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations will help you interact with databases using PHP.</li>
                    <li>While prior knowledge of these concepts is not mandatory, having a foundation in them will make it easier to grasp PHP concepts and apply them effectively.</li>
                    <li>Install PHP: Ensure that PHP is installed on your development environment. You can download and install PHP from the official PHP website (php.net) or use pre-packaged solutions like XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP, which include PHP, Apache, and MySQL.</li>
                    <li>Set up a development environment: Choose a code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) that suits your preferences. Some popular options for PHP development include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, PHPStorm, and Atom. Configure your chosen environment to highlight PHP syntax and provide code completion and debugging capabilities.</li>
                </ul>

        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">
            <header>Hello world</header>
            <p>
                <p>Set up your PHP environment: Ensure that PHP is installed on your computer or server. If you're using a local development environment like XAMPP or MAMP, make sure it's running.</p>
                <p>Create a new PHP file: Open a text editor or your chosen code editor/IDE and create a new file with a .php extension. For example, you can name it hello.php.</p>
                <p>Write the PHP code: In the PHP file, enter the following code:</p>
                <code>
                    &lt;?php
                    eho "Hello, World!";
                    ?&gt;
                </code>

        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>In PHP, variables are used to store and manipulate data. They are essentially containers that hold a value, which can be a number, text, or any other type of data.</p>
            <p>you can declare a variable by using the "$" symbol followed by the variable name. For example: "$message".</p>
            <p>PHP variable names must start with a letter or underscore, followed by any combination of letters, numbers, or underscores. Variable names are case-sensitive, so "$message" and "$Message" are considered different variables.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_variables">
            <header>Declaring variables</header>
            <article>
                You can assign a value to a variable using the assignment operator "=". There are multiple ways to declare variables. Here are the different methods:
                <p>
                    Basic Declaration: The most common way to declare a variable is by using the "$" symbol followed by the variable name. For example:
                    <code>
                        $name = "John";
                        $age = 25;
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Variable Variables: PHP allows you to create variable variables, where the name of a variable is based on the value of another variable. This is achieved by using two dollar signs "$$" before the variable name. For example:
                    <code>
                        $varName = "message";
                        $$varName = "Hello, World!";

                        echo $message;  // Output: Hello, World!
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dynamic Variable Names using curly braces: Curly braces "{}" can be used to enclose a variable name when it needs to be evaluated dynamically. For example:
                    <code>
                        $userType = "admin";
                        $adminName = "John";

                        echo ${$userType . "Name"};  // Output: John
                    </code>
                </p>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
            <header>Variable scope</header>
            <article>
                <p>Variable scope in PHP refers to the accessibility or visibility of variables within different parts of a PHP script. The scope determines where a variable can be accessed and used. PHP has different types of variable scopes:</p>
                <p>Global Scope: Variables declared outside of any function or class have a global scope. They can be accessed from anywhere in the script, including inside functions or classes. For example:
                    <code>
                        $globalVar = 10;

                        function myFunction() {
                            echo $globalVar;  // Accessible inside functions
                        }
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Local Scope: Variables declared within a function have a local scope. They can only be accessed within that function and are not accessible outside of it. For example:
                    <code>
                        function myFunction() {
                            $localVar = 20;
                            echo $localVar;  // Accessible within the function
                        }
                        
                        echo $localVar;  // Not accessible outside the function
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>Static Local Scope: PHP also supports static local variables within functions. These variables retain their value between function calls. They are declared using the "static" keyword within the function. For example:
                    <code>
                        function myFunction() {
                            static $counter = 0;
                            $counter++;
                            echo $counter;
                        }
                        
                        myFunction();  // Output: 1
                        myFunction();  // Output: 2
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Class Scope: Variables declared within a class have a class scope. They can be accessed within the class methods (functions) using the "$this" keyword. These variables are known as properties. For example:
                    <code>
                        class MyClass {
                            public $property = "Value";
                        
                            public function myMethod() {
                                echo $this->property;
                            }
                        }
                        
                        $obj = new MyClass();
                        $obj->myMethod();  // Output: Value
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>It's important to note that variables declared within different scopes can have the same name without causing conflicts. The variable with the most immediate scope takes precedence. If you need to access a global variable within a function, you can use the "global" keyword to explicitly indicate that you want to access the global variable.</p>
                <p>Understanding variable scope is crucial to prevent naming conflicts and manage the visibility and accessibility of variables within your PHP scripts.</p>

            <header>Constants</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Constants: PHP also allows the declaration of constants, which are variables with values that cannot be changed once defined. Constants are declared using the "define()" function or the "const" keyword. For example:
                    <code>
                        define("PI", 3.14);
                        const MAX_VALUE = 100;

                <p>PHP variables can hold different types of data:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Integer: Represents whole numbers (e.g., `$age = 25`).</li>
                    <li>Float: Represents decimal numbers (e.g., `$price = 3.99`).</li>
                    <li>String: Represents text (e.g., `$name = "John"`).</li>
                    <li>Boolean: Represents true or false values (e.g., `$isLogged = true`).</li>
                    <li>Array: Represents a collection of values (e.g., `$numbers = [1, 2, 3]`).</li>
                    <li>Object: Represents an instance of a class.</li>
                    <li>Null: Represents the absence of a value (e.g., `$result = null`).</li>

                <p>
                    Conditional statements allow you to make decisions based on certain conditions.
                    <code>
                        if ($x > 10) {
                            echo "x is greater than 10";

                <p>Include and require statements are used to include external PHP files within your code.
                    <code>
                        include "header.php";
                        require "functions.php";
                    </code>

                <p>Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform specific tasks. They allow you to encapsulate a sequence of instructions into a single unit, which can be called and executed multiple times throughout your PHP script.</p>
                <p>Basic Function Declaration: The basic syntax for declaring a function in PHP is as follows:
                    <code>
                        function functionName() {
                            // Code to be executed
                        }
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Function Name: Choose a meaningful name for your function that describes its purpose. Function names should follow the same naming conventions as variable names, such as starting with a letter or underscore, followed by letters, numbers, or underscores.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Function Parameters: Functions can accept parameters (also known as arguments) to receive input data. Parameters are declared within parentheses after the function name. Multiple parameters are separated by commas. For example:
                    <code>
                        function greet($name) {
                            echo "Hello, $name!";
                        }
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Return Values: Functions can also return values using the `return` statement. The returned value can be assigned to a variable or used directly in the script. For example:
                    <code>
                        function add($num1, $num2) {
                            return $num1 + $num2;
                        }
                        
                        $result = add(2, 3);  // $result will hold the value 5
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Function Invocation: To execute or call a function, simply use the function name followed by parentheses. If the function has parameters, provide the corresponding values inside the parentheses. For example:
                    <code>
                        greet("John");  // Output: Hello, John!
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>Function Scope: Functions have their own scope, which means variables declared inside a function are only accessible within that function unless they are declared as global variables using the `global` keyword.</p>
                <p>Function Overloading: PHP does not support function overloading by default (defining multiple functions with the same name but different parameter lists). However, you can achieve similar functionality using variable-length argument lists or conditional logic inside the function.</p>
                <p>Function Documentation: It is considered good practice to provide documentation for your functions, describing their purpose, parameters, and return values. This helps other developers understand and use your functions correctly.</p>
                <p>Built-in Functions: PHP comes with numerous built-in functions that provide various functionalities, such as string manipulation, array operations, mathematical calculations, file handling, and more. These functions are ready to use without the need for explicit declaration.</p>
                <p>Declaring functions allows you to write modular and reusable code, making your PHP scripts more organized and maintainable. By encapsulating tasks into functions, you can improve code readability and reusability.</p>
